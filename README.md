We know that graceful degradation is the practice of first starting with the best user experience, but bringing it down to lower levels while still maintaining its core functionality. In essence, it lowers the quality in a graceful manner. On the other hand, Service Workers are a progressive enhancement technique that enables features such as caching. In essentially allow the user to benefit from faster load times and not having to download resources over and over again. Service workers were implemented in this lab in a way that complements graceful degradation. If Service Workers were not available for the user, such as it not being supported in their browser, the application would download what was necessary to still function correctly. It is abundantly clear that the two concepts of Gracful Degradation and Service Workers are very much related.
